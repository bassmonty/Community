		<p align="center">This website is a tool for people who want to get involved within their communities.</p>
		<p>Our goal is simple. We want people to be connected! 
		Our plan isn't so grand as to connect everyone like the big social networks do,
		we want you to get to know the people in your immediate vicinity: where you live!
		There are many avantages to knowing your neighbors well! </p>
		<p>Here's what you can do now:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>View information about <a href="/Community/viewCommunity">your community</a>.</li>
			<li>Check out other <a href="/Community/listUsers">residents in your living community</a>.</li>
			<li>Check out <a href="/Community/listCommunities">neighboring communities</a> that are connecting people in the same way.</li>
			<li><a href="/Community/listComments">Post comments</a> for your neighbors</li>
			<li><a href="/Community/contactUs">Contact us</a> with any suggestions or problems. Or tell us if you'd like us to add your community!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here's our vision for the future:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Residents will be able to upload a profile picture.</li>
			<li>Residents will be able to add a list of interests to their profiles, creating a new way to connect and bond with their neighbors.</li>
			<li>Management at your living community will have a bulletin board to post news, events, and updates for residents.</li>
			<li>Residents will be able to organize community events through an events page.</li>
			
		</ul>
		<p>How we plan to grow long term:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Building similar networks for Home Owner Associations</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
		
		
		Apartment Complexes can manage their apartments,...
		Residents can meet others in their community, post activities, opportunities, pay rent, etc...
	
		Management and Residents should work together to promote their community.
	
		Management can access photos of Residents apartments so as to advertise the good things about the complex
	
		Residents can communicate directly with management, reserve bbqs, set appointments, post activities...
